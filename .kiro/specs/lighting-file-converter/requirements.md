# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Go application that converts photometric lighting files between IES, LDT, and CIE formats. The application serves lighting professionals, engineers, and manufacturers who need to work with different photometric data formats across various tools and systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a lighting professional, I want to convert photometric files between different formats, so that I can use the same lighting data across different software tools and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides an IES file THEN the system SHALL convert it to LDT or CIE format
2. WHEN a user provides an LDT file THEN the system SHALL convert it to IES or CIE format  
3. WHEN a user provides a CIE file THEN the system SHALL convert it to IES or LDT format
4. WHEN converting between formats THEN the system SHALL preserve photometric data integrity with 99.9% accuracy
5. WHEN handling different photometry types (Type A, B, C) THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility across formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a lighting engineer, I want the system to validate file formats and data consistency, so that I can trust the accuracy of converted files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing an IES file THEN the system SHALL validate compliance with LM-63-1995 and LM-63-2002 standards
2. WHEN processing an LDT file THEN the system SHALL validate compliance with EULUMDAT 1.0 format
3. WHEN processing a CIE file THEN the system SHALL validate compliance with CIE LTL format
4. WHEN validating photometric data THEN the system SHALL check data consistency and report any issues
5. WHEN validating luminaire geometry THEN the system SHALL verify parameter compatibility
6. WHEN conversion limitations exist THEN the system SHALL report warnings to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a lighting manufacturer, I want to process multiple files efficiently, so that I can convert large batches of photometric data quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing files up to 10MB THEN the system SHALL complete conversion within 2 seconds
2. WHEN handling multiple files THEN the system SHALL support concurrent file conversions
3. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL use memory-efficient parsing techniques
4. WHEN serving multiple users THEN the system SHALL maintain scalable architecture
5. WHEN handling both decimal separators (. and ,) THEN the system SHALL process files correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating lighting data conversion, I want both CLI and REST API interfaces, so that I can use the converter in different application contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL provide commands for single file conversion
2. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL support batch processing with directory input/output
3. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL provide validation-only mode
4. WHEN using the REST API THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for file upload and conversion
5. WHEN using the REST API THEN the system SHALL support file download capabilities
6. WHEN using either interface THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive error reporting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be secure and reliable, so that it can be deployed safely in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving file uploads THEN the system SHALL validate input to prevent malicious files
2. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL verify file types beyond extension checking
3. WHEN handling large requests THEN the system SHALL enforce memory limits to prevent DoS attacks
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide graceful failure modes with meaningful messages
5. WHEN conversions fail THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capability
6. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL implement secure file handling and cleanup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cross-platform user, I want the application to work on different operating systems, so that I can use it regardless of my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN it SHALL run on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. WHEN building the application THEN it SHALL use Go version 1.21 or higher
3. WHEN using core conversion logic THEN it SHALL not require external dependencies
4. WHEN storing conversion history THEN database support SHALL be optional
5. WHEN following standards THEN the system SHALL adhere to IEEE floating-point arithmetic

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality-focused developer, I want comprehensive testing and documentation, so that the application is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the application THEN it SHALL achieve greater than 90% code coverage
2. WHEN documenting the API THEN it SHALL provide OpenAPI specification
3. WHEN providing CLI help THEN it SHALL include clear documentation and examples
4. WHEN reporting conversions THEN it SHALL provide detailed logs and reports
5. WHEN measuring performance THEN typical files SHALL process under 2 seconds
