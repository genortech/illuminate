# Requirements: Lighting Data File Converter (Go)

## Project Overview
Develop a Go application that converts photometric lighting files between IES, LDT, and CIE formats for lighting professionals, engineers, and manufacturers.

## Functional Requirements

### File Processing
- Accept input files in .IES, .LDT (EULUMDAT), and .CIE formats
- Parse and validate file structure according to industry standards:
  - IES: Support LM-63-1995, LM-63-2002 standards
  - LDT: Support EULUMDAT 1.0 format
  - CIE: Support CIE LTL (Luminaire Testing Laboratory) format
- Convert between all format combinations (IES⇆LDT, IES⇆CIE, LDT⇆CIE)
- Preserve photometric data integrity during conversion
- Handle different photometry types (Type A, B, C)
- Support both decimal point separators (. and ,)

### API Interface
- Command-line interface for batch processing
- REST API endpoints for web integration
- File upload and download capabilities
- Validation and error reporting

### Data Validation
- Verify file format compliance
- Check photometric data consistency
- Validate luminaire geometry parameters
- Report conversion warnings and limitations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Process files up to 10MB within 2 seconds
- Support concurrent file conversions
- Memory-efficient parsing for large files
- Scalable architecture for multiple simultaneous users

### Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Graceful failure modes with meaningful error messages
- Data integrity validation pre and post-conversion
- Rollback capability for failed conversions

### Usability
- Clear CLI help documentation
- Intuitive REST API with OpenAPI specification
- Detailed conversion logs and reports
- Support for batch processing multiple files

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Requirements
- Go version 1.21 or higher
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- No external dependencies for core conversion logic
- Optional database support for conversion history

### Standards Compliance
- Strict adherence to IES LM-63 standards
- Full EULUMDAT format compatibility
- CIE photometric data format support
- IEEE standards for floating-point arithmetic

### Security
- Input validation to prevent malicious file uploads
- File type verification beyond extension checking
- Memory limit enforcement to prevent DoS attacks
- Secure file handling and cleanup

## Success Criteria
- 99.9% accuracy in photometric data conversion
- Support for all major lighting industry file formats
- Processing time under 2 seconds for typical files
- Zero data loss during format conversion
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
